# 🚀 My DevOps Daily Journey – Learn One Task a Day

Welcome to my **DevOps learning journey** — a practical, hands-on path I created to break into the world of DevOps by doing **just one small task every day**. Whether you're a student, fresher, or career switcher, this repository can be your motivation to start small and grow big.

## 🌱 Why This Repo?

Most people want to learn DevOps but get overwhelmed by long tutorials or big courses. I decided to **take one small step every day**, practicing with real tools like Linux, Git, Docker, Jenkins, and Cloud platforms — and **document everything publicly** to stay accountable.

## 💡 What You'll See Here

- Real DevOps tasks done daily  
- Screenshots, code snippets, and PDF reports  
- Simple automation scripts using Shell  
- CI/CD experiments with GitHub and Jenkins  
- Docker-based deployments and app packaging  
- Cloud experiments using AWS  
- Git collaboration, conflict resolution, and teamwork  

Each folder or commit reflects progress — not perfection. It's raw, real, and meant to **build momentum**.
